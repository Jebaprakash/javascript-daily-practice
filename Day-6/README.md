# Day 06 – Objects & Destructuring 🧱

## 📌 Focus
Working with JavaScript objects using modern patterns such as
destructuring, computed properties, and safe comparison techniques.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Object destructuring (nested)
- Array + object destructuring together
- Computed property names
- Object immutability
- Object comparison by value vs reference

---

## ✅ Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Deep Destructuring
- Extracted nested object values using a single destructuring statement
- Combined array and object destructuring

**Key Learnings:**
- Destructuring can be nested deeply
- Arrays and objects can be destructured together
- Improves readability and reduces repetitive code

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Dynamic Object Updates
- Updated and added object properties dynamically
- Returned a new object without mutating the original

**Key Learnings:**
- Use computed property names (`[key]`)
- Spread operator helps maintain immutability
- Essential for React state updates and reducers

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Object Comparison
- Identified why object comparison using `===` fails
- Implemented a proper value-based comparison approach

**Key Learnings:**
- Objects are compared by reference, not by value
- Deep comparison is required for real equality checks
- Understanding references prevents subtle bugs

---

## 🧠 Bonus: `this` in Objects
- Compared `this` behavior in arrow functions vs normal methods

**Key Learnings:**
- Arrow functions do not have their own `this`
- Regular methods bind `this` to the object

- `task-1.js` → Deep destructuring example
- `task-2.js` → Dynamic object update
- `task-3.js` → Object comparison logic

---

## 🎯 Outcome
- Strong command over object manipulation
- Ability to write clean, immutable JavaScript
- Confidence in handling object-based interview questions
