# Day 05 – Array Methods Deep Dive 🔁

## 📌 Focus
Mastering JavaScript array methods by practicing real-world data
transformations using `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- `Array.map()` – data transformation
- `Array.filter()` – conditional selection
- `Array.reduce()` – aggregation & accumulation
- Immutability in arrays
- Method chaining

---

## ✅ Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Transform Data with `map()`
- Added derived properties to objects without mutating the original array
- Used object spread syntax for clean transformations

**Key Learnings:**
- `map()` always returns a new array
- Avoid mutating original data structures
- Spread syntax helps maintain immutability

---

### 🔹 Task 2: Filter with Business Logic
- Filtered products based on multiple conditions
- Combined logical operators inside `filter()`

**Key Learnings:**
- `filter()` returns only matching elements
- Real-world logic often requires compound conditions

---

### 🔹 Task 3: Aggregate Data with `reduce()`
- Calculated total order amount using `reduce()`
- Used proper initial accumulator value

**Key Learnings:**
- `reduce()` can replace loops for aggregation
- Initial value prevents unexpected bugs
- Clean and predictable accumulation logic

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Method Chaining
- Transformed and joined array elements in a single chain

**Key Learnings:**
- Method chaining leads to concise and readable code
- Common in functional programming patterns
